## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 18+
- Git

### Local Development

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ALLIN.git
cd ALLIN
```

2. **Set up the backend**
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt

# Initialize database
python backend/migrations/001_init_database.py --init
```

3. **Set up the frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. **Start the development servers**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# Terminal 2: Start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

5. **Access the application**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

```python
def calculate_user_score(user_id: int, activity_data: dict) -> float:
    """
    Calculate user score based on activity data.
    
    Args:
        user_id: The user's unique identifier
        activity_data: Dictionary containing user activity metrics
        
    Returns:
        float: Calculated user score
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If user_id is invalid
    """
    if user_id <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid user_id")
    
    # Implementation here
    return score
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript (Frontend)

- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper error handling

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

const UserProfileComponent: React.FC<{ user: UserProfile }> = ({ user }) => {
  const handleUpdate = async (data: Partial<UserProfile>) => {
    try {
      // Implementation
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to update user profile:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="user-profile">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Git Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(auth): add JWT token refresh functionality
fix(chat): resolve message ordering issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```
